### One project to rule them all !


I use Java because I have to.  
To get the AP Computer Science scores.  
So it's just a tool for my journey to college.  
I will probably never use it again in real production and working.  
Unless its performance is same as or better than: Rust(my favorite), Go, Modern C++, Nim;  
Or unless it's more easy-to-use than: JavaScript, Python;
